# Job-bot (v0)
Job-bot is a program that helps with the grueling process of job-hunting by automating it away.
If employers are using automation and AI tools to assist in their application process, then why shouldn't we?

Job-bot uses Selenium in combination with OpenAI's api to automate browser interactions related to job applications. 
OpenAI's gpt4-o model is used to write cover letters and determine whether a job is relevant to the applicant in question. 

Soon, the bot will support automation for Easy-Apply jobs on Dice's platform. If current capabilities allow it, there are 
plans to add support for external-site applications through integration with another Selenium-AI library I am creating here: [Selenium Python with AI](https://github.com/AndrewKassab/selenium_ai)

# Setup

COMING SOON.
